# DELIVERY OF RESULTS FROM EXOME ANALYSIS WITH SAREK

## Analysis
Samples were analysed with the Sarek pipeline release {{ release }}. In short, the pipeline does the following:
Reads from fastq-files were mapped to a reference genome using BWA.
Bam-files were de-duplicated with GATK MarkDuplicates.
Base quality score recalibration tables were created with GATK BaseRecalibrator. 
The tables were then used in GATK ApplyBQSR to create recalibrated bam-files.
SNVs and small indels were called with GATK HaplotypeCaller.
Variants were annoted with SnpEff.

For details on the pipeline, folder structure and how to interpret results, please refer to the Sarek documentation:
https://nf-co.re/sarek/{{ release }}

After running the pipeline, Picard CollectHsMetrics was used to evaluate the coverage

## Known issues

- Twist bait intervals are not publicly available and therefore, when running CollectHsMetrics (Picard), the target intervals are used to specify both target and bait. 
This will lead to some incorrect entries in the HsMetrics table in the MultiQC-report, i.e. entries regarding baits should be neglected.

## Additional information 

- The original target file used for the analysis can be found here https://www.twistbioscience.com/resources/bed-file/twist-human-comprehensive-exome-panel-bed-files
Note that each region in this file was padded with 100 bp upstream and downstream before submitting it to the pipeline. 
- Note that samples that are sequenced on more than one flowcell/lane will be suffixed accordingly for some modules in the MultiQC report.
A sample that has been sequenced twice will for some metrics be presented as a joint vaule for <sample name>, and with one value per run, i.e. <sample name>_1 and <sample_name>_2. 
- To apply the recalibrations table to the deduplicated .bam-files use the script Resources/apply_recalibration.sh
